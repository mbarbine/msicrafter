## Phase 9: Performance, Robustness & Error Handling Refinements (Outline)

- **Performance Tuning:**  
  - Optimize COM interactions and memory use.  
  - Add caching where repeated reads are necessary.

- **Enhanced Error Handling:**  
  - Expand the `SafeExecute` wrapper to include retry logic.  
  - Improve detailed logging to catch intermittent COM errors.

- **Stress Testing:**  
  - Use larger MSI files and simulate multiple concurrent operations to identify bottlenecks.

## Phase 10: Packaging, Final QA & Official Release (Outline)

- **Packaging:**  
  - Build a standalone executable (or Windows installer).  
  - Ensure compatibility with supported Windows versions.

- **Final Quality Assurance:**  
  - Run full integration tests, user acceptance tests, and a security review.  
  - Prepare release notes and documentation.

- **Release:**  
  - Publish the tool on GitHub Releases and any relevant channels.  
  - Set up channels for community feedback and support.

## Next Steps

1. **Implement and Test Phase 8:**  
   - Add the provided test files to your repository and run `go test ./...` to verify functionality.  
   - Commit and push the CI/CD workflow file.

2. **Update Documentation:**  
   - Revise the README with usage examples and testing instructions.
   - Create additional developer documentation as needed.

3. **Gather Feedback:**  
   - Share the beta release with early users/testers and collect feedback on usability and performance.

4. **Prepare for Phase 9:**  
   - Analyze performance on larger MSI files.
   - Enhance error handling and logging based on test outcomes.

5. **Plan Phase 10:**  
   - Finalize packaging and release procedures.
